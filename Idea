Email AI Agent
An AI-powered email assistant that organizes Gmail into morning/afternoon/evening summaries, avoids duplicates via Supabase, flags urgent emails with NLP, and answers queries via a non-reply chatbot—keeping users focused without inbox overload.

Core Features
- Time-based email segmentation (morning/afternoon/evening summaries).
- Gmail API integration for secure, real-time email fetching.
- Duplicate prevention using Supabase to track processed emails.
- Importance detection via keywords, NLP, and user-defined rules.
- Summaries highlighting urgent emails requiring responses.
- Memory system to track unresolved emails across summaries.
- Customizable time slots for digest schedules.
- Follow-up reminders for pending actions (24/48-hour nudges).
- Secure authentication with Google OAuth and Supabase RLS.
- Cross-platform notifications (email/WhatsApp) for summaries.

Advanced Features
- NLP-driven urgency detection (spaCy/Hugging Face).
- One-click resolution (mark emails as "done" from the summary).
- Recurring task tracking for long-term follow-ups.
- Customizable templates for digest formatting (Markdown/HTML).
- Time zone awareness for global users.
- Encrypted email metadata storage in Supabase.
- User feedback loop ("Not Important" flag to improve AI accuracy).
- Batch processing to handle API rate limits.
- Email Query Chatbot:
- Natural language Q&A about processed emails (e.g., “Find invoices from Vendor X”).
- Semantic search across email content using NLP embeddings.
- Intent recognition to filter actionable vs. informational queries.
- Link to source emails for context without direct replies.
- Privacy-focused: Only accesses emails the user has already processed.

Setup & Authentication
User connects Gmail via OAuth.
Saves preferences (time slots, priority senders) in Supabase.
Initializes cron jobs for email checks.

Email Fetching
Cron triggers at end of each time slot (morning/afternoon/evening).
Fetches new emails via Gmail API.
Filters duplicates using Supabase processed_emails table.

Email Processing
Classification:
LangChain classifies emails as "Urgent," "Important," or "Normal" using LLM.
Summarization:
LangChain generates concise summaries for each email.
Embedding:
Creates embeddings for chatbot search (stored in Supabase pgvector).
Storage:
Saves email metadata, summaries, and embeddings in Supabase.

Summary Generation & Notification
Queries Supabase for emails in the current time slot.
Formats summary using LLM.
Sends summary via email/WhatsApp.

Chatbot Query Handling
User submits query (e.g., "Find emails about Project X").
LangChain RAG pipeline:
Embeds query and retrieves relevant emails from Supabase.
LLM synthesizes a natural language response.
Displays response with links to source emails.

Follow-Up & Memory
Daily cron checks for unresolved urgent emails.
Sends reminders for pending actions.
Updates memory in Supabase based on user feedback (e.g., "Mark as Done").

Example Workflow with Minimal Storage
Fetch emails via Gmail API.
Classify and summarize using LLM.
Generate embeddings for chatbot search.
Store only metadata, summaries, and embeddings in Supabase.
Fetch raw email content from Gmail API only when needed (e.g., for chatbot responses).
